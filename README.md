# Contact-Book-Project

You can save your mobile numbers/contact numbers in a text file using this tool.

## How to Use
- For now, this tool can only work in console. In future, I will make this useful for everyone by converting it into GUI :)
- Using this, is pretty easy, just run the py file and you are good to go! It will show all the intructions after running :)

## Why I made this?
I made this tool to improve my programming skills and to help people with this tool!

## Important Note
- I tried a lot to add edit function in the book but I failed :( 
 Maybe I will add in future..
- You have to change the file path in the code. Just make a txt file, copy its path, amd change it in the code.
